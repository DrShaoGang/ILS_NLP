# NLP Roles

## Careers in Machine Learning (ML)
The demand for machine learning (ML) skills is growing rapidly. The ML roles similar to NLP. The technical skills with the highest demand for working in ML and NLP are: <br>
&nbsp;  **Python programming** <br>
&nbsp;  **SQL** <br>
&nbsp;  **Data science** <br>
&nbsp;  **Data mining** <br>
&nbsp;  **Data analysis** <br>

## Data scientist or data analyst

As a data scientist or data analyst, you use analytic and statistical skills to collect, analyze, and interpret large datasets. When you work on NLP applications, you might be asked to evaluate ML models to optimize outputs. For example, you could be asked to determine whether a topic modeling application correctly classifies topics, and whether classification errors are statistically significant. Data scientists and analysts often work with what are known as big data. Big data datasets are characterized by what is known as the four V’s (volume, variety, velocity, and veracity). <br>

Data scientists and analysts acquire and prepare data. They also explore and analyze datasets to help select appropriate algorithms and models. When data scientists and analysts work with big data datasets, they develop strategies for handling the four V’s. Data scientists and analysts often validate findings and present recommendations to stakeholders.
