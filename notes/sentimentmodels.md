# Algorithms for Sentiment Analysis

list of machine learning models for sentiment from NLTK, SPACY, SKLearn, Bert)


##  NLTK
[NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/howto/sentiment.html) is a Python library for natural language processing that includes several tools for sentiment analysis, including classifiers and sentiment lexicons. NLTK is a well-established and widely used library for natural language processing, and its sentiment analysis tools are particularly powerful when combined with other NLTK tools.

***Key Features*** 
- A comprehensive library for natural language processing.
- Provides various tools and algorithms for sentiment analysis, such as lexicon-based and machine learning–based approaches.
- Has a large community and extensive documentation.

## TextBlob
TextBlob is a beginner-friendly library built on top of NLTK and provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing sentiment analysis. It is also highly customizable as it includes other NLP tools such as part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase extraction. This enables users to use TextBlob for a variety of natural language processing tasks beyond sentiment analysis.

Key Features
- Built on top of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
- Provides a simple API for common NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
- Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## VADER 
Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is a library specifically designed for social media sentiment analysis and includes a lexicon-based approach that is tuned for social media language. It includes a pre-built sentiment lexicon with intensity measures for positive and negative sentiment, and it incorporates rules for handling sentiment intensifiers, emojis, and other social media–specific features. VADER is particularly effective for analyzing sentiment in social media text due to its ability to handle complex language such as sarcasm, irony, and slang. It also provides a sentiment intensity score, which indicates the strength of the sentiment expressed in the text.

Key Features
- Designed to handle social media texts and emoticons.
- Uses lexicon and rule-based approach to sentiment analysis.
- Returns a sentiment score based on the positivity, negativity, and neutrality of the input text.

## SpaCy
SpaCy is a Python library known for its fast and efficient processing speed and includes a sentiment analysis component as part of its pipeline, making it a good choice for large-scale sentiment analysis tasks. It provides customizable rule-based matching and machine learning algorithms for text processing and entity recognition. SpaCy’s sentiment analysis models use a machine learning approach that is based on convolutional neural networks, which can handle complex language features such as negation and sarcasm.

Key Features 
- A modern NLP library for Python.
- Provides efficient processing of large volumes of text.
- Offers pre-trained models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks.
- Can be easily integrated into other Python applications.

## BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model for natural language processing developed by Google. BERT has achieved trailblazing results in many language processing tasks due to its ability to understand the context in which words are used. BERT is pre-trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, making it a powerful tool for sentiment analysis and other natural language processing tasks. It is also particularly effective for analyzing sentiment in complex, multi-sentence texts.

Key Features 
- A pre-trained deep learning model for natural language processing.
- Fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on various datasets.
- Can handle complex text structures and contexts.

## Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn is a free and popular machine learning Python library. It includes several tools for sentiment analysis, including classifiers and feature extraction tools. Scikit-learn has a simple interface for sentiment analysis, making it a good choice for beginners. Scikit-learn also includes many other machine learning tools for machine learning tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. A great option if you prefer to use one library for multiple modeling task.

Key Features 
- A machine learning library for Python.
- Offers various algorithms and models for sentiment analysis, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees.
- Provides tools for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
