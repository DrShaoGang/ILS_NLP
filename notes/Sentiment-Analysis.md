# Sentiment Analysis

In this lesson, we're going to learn how to use [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment), an English-language sentiment analysis tool designed for use with social media texts. This tool helps to calculate whether texts express positive or negative sentiment.

In this lesson, we will learn how to use VADER to:
- Calculate sentiment for individual sentences, tweets, and a fairy tale
- Make plots of how sentiment fluctuates over time and throughout a text

## Datasets

### Trump's Tweets

We're going to use VADER to analyze Donald Trump's tweets and plot the fluctuation of sentiment over time. The Trump tweets dataset is downloaded from [The Trump Twitter Archive](https://www.thetrumparchive.com/).

### Little Red Riding Hood

We're also going to use VADER to analyze the story "Little Red-Cap" (commonly known as "Little Red Riding Hood") from Grimms' fairy tales. The story is downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2591).

## What is Sentiment? What Exactly Are We Measuring?

What is sentiment analysis, exactly? What are we actually measuring with VADER?

These are tough and important questions. According to VADER's creators, C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, "Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is an active area of study in the field of natural language processing that analyzes people's **opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions** via the computational treatment of subjectivity in text" (["VADER"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)).

I would like to emphasize that "opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions" covers a *lot* of ground. These are complex categories of human experience that can be expressed in many different ways, especially in different contexts. In fact, that's why Hutto and Gilbert designed VADER specifically for *social media* texts, because sentiment gets expressed differently in social media posts than in, say, fictional stories or newspaper articles.

We want to remain critical and self-reflexive about what exactly we are measuring with VADER ‚Äî¬†especially when we apply VADER to non-social media texts, as we will with "Little Red-Cap" below. Too often I have encountered well-meaning students who want to understand complex social or textual phenomena (e.g., mental health, a reader's emotional experience of a story, opinions about climate change) by reducing it only to sentiment analysis scores, without doing more and without thinking more deeply about whether those scores actually capture what they're interested in.

So, yes, tools like VADER can be useful, as we will see below, but they are only useful when thoughtfully and deliberately applied.

## How VADER Was Built and How It Works

VADER, which stands for **V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner, calculates the sentiment of texts by referring to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores as well as by using a handful of simple rules.

You can read more about how VADER was designed in [C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert's published paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122), but here's a summary version: VADER's lexicon was created by enlisting 10 different people to rate thousands of words positively or negatively on a scale of -4 to 4 (you can scroll through the [lexicon on GitHub](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) and check it out for yourself ‚Äî each line consists of a word, the mean rating, standard deviation, and 10 individual human ratings).

[![](../../images/VADER-fig.png)](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)




*This figure shows the interface presented to the 10 raters for rating the sentiment of words. It is taken from ["VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text."](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)* 

For example, you can see that the acronym [ROFL](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L368) (Rolling on the Floor Laughing) has a mean rating of 2.7, the word [*crappy*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1622) has a mean rating of -2.5, and the word [*bliss*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1127) has a mean rating of 2.7. If you look at the 10 individual ratings for each entry, however, you can see interesting discrepancies. One person rated *bliss* as a 4, while another person rated *bliss* as a 1. Just how "positive" is the word *bliss*? What do *you* think?

What about [*cutesie*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1721)? It has a mean rating of 1, but two people rated it as a -1, and five people rated as a 2. Is *cutesie* an admiring adjective ‚Äî "[She was so cutesie I just had to talk to her](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cutesie)" ‚Äî or a diminutive slight ‚Äî "Ugh, her apartment was too cutesie"?

These difficult questions come up repeatedly when you read through the lexicon. Of course, VADER is designed to generalize beyond individual responses and interpretations, and it is not expected to capture the nuances of every single text. At the same time, whenever we use sentiment analysis tools, we want to ask: Does it matter that we're missing out on specific nuances? Is this the best tool for capturing what we're trying to study and understand?

In addition to its lexicon, VADER also calculates sentiment by considering 5 relatively simple rules:

> 1. If there's punctuation, especially exclamation points, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., "Mochi ice cream is bliss" üëç vs "Mochi ice cream is bliss!!!" üëçüëçüëç )

> 2. If there's capitalization, especially all caps, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., "Mochi ice cream is bliss" üëç vs "Mochi ice cream is BLISS" üëçüëçüëç )

> 3. If there are words like "extremely" or "absolutely", the sentiment should be increased ("Mochi ice cream is good" üëç  vs "Mochi ice cream is extremely good" üëçüëçüëç )

> 4. If there's a "but" in a sentence, the polarity of the sentiment should shift, and the sentiment that follows the "but" should be prioritized (e.g., "Mochi ice cream is nice" üëç vs "Mochi ice cream is nice, but it's a little blah" üëé )

> 5. If there's a negation before an important word, the sentiment polarity should be flipped ("Mochi ice cream is my favorite" üëç vs "Mochi ice cream is not my favorite" üëé )


Because VADER uses this lexicon and these simple rules, it works very fast and doesn't require any training or set up, unlike more sophisticated machine learning approaches. The simplicity is both its pro and con.

## Install and Import Libraries/Packages

So let's explore VADER!

To use it, we need to install the [vaderSentiment package](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) with pip.


```python
!pip install vaderSentiment
```

Then we will import the `SentimentIntensityAnalyser` and initialize it.


```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize VADER so we can use it later
sentimentAnalyser = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```

We are also going to import pandas for working with data and set the column width for pandas DataFrames to 400.


```python
import pandas as pd
pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 400
```

## Calculate Sentiment Scores

To calculate sentiment scores for a sentence or paragraph, we can use `sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores()` and input a string of text.

This method returns a Python dictionary of sentiment scores: how negative the sentence is between 0-1, how neutral the sentence is between 0-1, how positive the sentence is between 0-1, as well as a compound score between -1-1.

Most scholars uses the compound score to represent sentiment in their analyses, and we will use the compound score in this lesson, as well. Let's test it out with some sample sentences! 


```python
sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores("I like the Marvel movies")
```




    {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.361, 'pos': 0.639, 'compound': 0.6486}




```python
sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores("I don't like the Marvel movies")
```




    {'neg': 0.526, 'neu': 0.474, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5334}




```python
sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores("I despise the Marvel movies with every fiber of my being")
```




    {'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.634, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': 0.1027}




```python
sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores("I don't *not* like the Marvel movies")
```




    {'neg': 0.255, 'neu': 0.546, 'pos': 0.199, 'compound': -0.1307}



To make the scores more readable, below we make a list of sentences, loop through the list and calculate the polarity scores for each sentence, then print out each part of the sentiment scores dictionary in a nicely formatted f-string (a string that begins with f and allows you to insert Python variables).


```python
# List of sentences
sentences = ["I like the Marvel movies",
             "I don't like the Marvel movies",
             "I despise the Marvel movies with every fiber of my being",
             "I don't *not* live the Marvel movies"]

# Loop through list of sentences
for sentence in sentences:
    # Run VADER on each sentence
    sentiment_scores = sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores(sentence)
    
    # Print scores for each sentence
    print(f"""'{sentence}' \n
üôÅ Negative Sentiment: {sentiment_scores['neg']} \n  
üòê Neutral Sentiment: {sentiment_scores['neu']} \n
üòÄ Positive Sentiment: {sentiment_scores['pos']} \n
‚ú® Compound Sentiment: {sentiment_scores['compound']} \n
--- \n""")
```

    'I like the Marvel movies' 
    
    üôÅ Negative Sentiment: 0.0 
      
    üòê Neutral Sentiment: 0.361 
    
    üòÄ Positive Sentiment: 0.639 
    
    ‚ú® Compound Sentiment: 0.6486 
    
    --- 
    
    'I don't like the Marvel movies' 
    
    üôÅ Negative Sentiment: 0.526 
      
    üòê Neutral Sentiment: 0.474 
    
    üòÄ Positive Sentiment: 0.0 
    
    ‚ú® Compound Sentiment: -0.5334 
    
    --- 
    
    'I despise the Marvel movies with every fiber of my being' 
    
    üôÅ Negative Sentiment: 0.169 
      
    üòê Neutral Sentiment: 0.634 
    
    üòÄ Positive Sentiment: 0.197 
    
    ‚ú® Compound Sentiment: 0.1027 
    
    --- 
    
    'I don't *not* live the Marvel movies' 
    
    üôÅ Negative Sentiment: 0.28 
      
    üòê Neutral Sentiment: 0.72 
    
    üòÄ Positive Sentiment: 0.0 
    
    ‚ú® Compound Sentiment: -0.3252 
    
    --- 
    


We can see moments where VADER is both working and not working in the examples above. VADER registers that "I like the Marvel movies" represents the overall most positive sentiment, while "I don't like the Marvel movies" is the most negative sentiment, and "I don't *not* like the Marvel movies" is negative but not quite as negative as a straight up "don't like."

However, VADER does not capture that "I despise the Marvel movies with every fiber of my being" should be the *most* negative sentiment of the bunch. In fact, VADER scores this sentence in the mildly positive range. This example should remind us that VADER typically works best when it is used in aggregate and applied to many examples, such that specific nuances and exceptions like these matter less and come out in the wash.

## Calculate Sentiment Scores for Donald Trump's Tweets

Let's try using VADER on many texts:¬†Donald Trump's corpus of tweets from 2009 to 2021 (when he was suspended from Twitter).

### Load CSV File

We will load the Trump tweets CSV file with pandas and drop some of the columns that we don't need.

### Calculate Sentiment for All Rows in a CSV

To calculate the sentiment for each tweet in the CSV file and add a new column that contains this information, we will create a function that will take in any text and output the compound sentiment score.


```python
def calculate_sentiment(text):
    # Run VADER on the text
    scores = sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores(text)
    # Extract the compound score
    compound_score = scores['compound']
    # Return compound score
    return compound_score
```

Let's test it out!


```python
calculate_sentiment('I like the Marvel movies')
```




    0.6486



Nice, it works! Now we can apply it to every row in the CSV file with the `.apply()` method. In the same line of code, we are making new column "sentiment_score", where we are outputting our results.


```python
# Apply the function to every row in the "text" column and output the results into a new column "sentiment_score"
trump_df['sentiment_score'] = trump_df['text'].apply(calculate_sentiment)
```

Let's sort the DataFrame and examine the top 10 tweets with the highest compound sentiment.


```python
trump_df.sort_values(by='sentiment_score', ascending=False)[:10]
```

### Plot Sentiment Over Time

We can plot how Trump's sentiment in his tweets fluctuates over time by first converting the date column to a datetime value and then making it the index of the DataFrame, which makes it easier to work with time series data.


```python
# Convert the date column to datetime values
trump_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(trump_df['date'])

# Make date the index of the DataFrame
trump_df = trump_df.set_index('date')
```


```python
trump_df.head(2)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

      <th>text</th>
      <th>favorites</th>
      <th>retweets</th>
      <th>sentiment_score</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

Then we will group the tweets by month using `.resample()`, a special method for datetime indices, and calculate the average (`.mean()`) compound score for each month. Finally, we will plot these averages.


```python
trump_df.resample('M')['sentiment_score'].mean().plot(
    title="Trump's Tweet Sentiment by Month");
```


    
![png](Sentiment-Analysis_files/Sentiment-Analysis_48_0.png)
    


We can also `.resample()` by day ('D'), week ('W'), or year ('Y').


```python
trump_df.resample('D')['sentiment_score'].mean().plot(
    title="Trump's Tweet Sentiment by Day");
```


    
![png](Sentiment-Analysis_files/Sentiment-Analysis_50_0.png)
    


By using `.loc`, we can also zoom in on particular time periods, such as the year 2020.


```python
trump_df.loc["2020"].resample('W')['sentiment_score'].mean().plot(title="Trump's Tweet Sentiment by Week in 2020");
```


    
![png](Sentiment-Analysis_files/Sentiment-Analysis_52_0.png)
    


Hmm looks like there's a major dip near the end of November 2020...around the same time that Donald Trump was not re-elected for president of the United States.... Let's take a closer look.


```python
trump_df.loc["2020-11-07":"2020-11-30"].sort_values(by='sentiment_score')[:10]
```

Indeed, we can see a lot of negative sentiment expressed about the election, including claims of its fradulence.

## Calculate Sentiment Scores for Little Red Riding Hood

To calculate sentiment scores for the fairy tale "Little Red Cap," we first need to read in the text file.

We're also going to replace line breaks with spaces to because there are line breaks in the middle of sentences.


```python
# Read in text file
text = open("../texts/literature/Grimms-Little-Red-Cap.txt").read()
# Replace line breaks with spaces
text = text.replace('\n', ' ')
```

### Install and Import NLTK

Next we need to break the text into sentences.

An easy way to break text into sentences, or to "tokenize" them into sentences, is to use [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), a Python library for text analysis natural language processing.


```python
!pip install nltk
```

Let's import nltk and download the model that will help us get sentences.


```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

To break a string into individual sentences, we can use `nltk.sent_tokenize()`


```python
nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
```




    ['LITTLE RED-CAP   Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl, who was loved by every one who looked at her, and most of all by her Grandmother.',
     'There was nothing that she would not have given the child!',
     'Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would not wear anything else.',
     'So she was always called Little Red-Cap.',
     'One day, her Mother said to her, ‚ÄúCome, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.',
     'Take them to your Grandmother.',
     'She is ill and weak, and they will do her good.',
     'Set out before it gets hot.',
     'Walk nicely and quietly.',
     'Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing!',
     'When you go into her room, don‚Äôt forget to say ‚ÄòGood morning,‚Äô and don‚Äôt stop to peep into every corner, before you do it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take great care,‚Äù said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her hand on it.',
     'The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour‚Äôs distance from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a Wolf met her.',
     'Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.',
     '‚ÄúGood-day, Little Red-Cap,‚Äù said he.',
     '‚ÄúThank you kindly, Wolf.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhither away so early, Little Red-Cap?‚Äù  ‚ÄúTo my Grandmother‚Äôs.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat have you got in your apron?‚Äù  ‚ÄúCake and wine.',
     'Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick Grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhere does your Grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?‚Äù  ‚ÄúA good quarter of an hour farther on in the wood.',
     'Her house stands under the three large oak-trees; the nut-trees are just below.',
     'You surely must know it,‚Äù replied Little Red-Cap.',
     'The Wolf thought to himself, ‚ÄúWhat a tender young creature!',
     'what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.',
     'I must act craftily, so as to catch both.‚Äù  He walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said, ‚ÄúSee, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?',
     'I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.',
     'You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else in the wood is merry.‚Äù  Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, ‚ÄúSuppose I take Grandmother a fresh nosegay.',
     'That would please her too.',
     'It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.‚Äù  And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.',
     'And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and thus got deeper and deeper into the wood.',
     'Meanwhile, the Wolf ran straight to the Grandmother‚Äôs house and knocked at the door.',
     '‚ÄúWho is there?‚Äù  ‚ÄúLittle Red-Cap,‚Äù replied the Wolf.',
     '‚ÄúShe is bringing cake and wine.',
     'Open the door.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLift the latch,‚Äù called out the Grandmother, ‚ÄúI am too weak, and cannot get up.‚Äù  The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the Grandmother‚Äôs bed, and devoured her.',
     'Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed, and drew the curtains.',
     'Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers.',
     'When she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.',
     'She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open.',
     'And when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to herself, ‚ÄúOh dear!',
     'how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with Grandmother so much.‚Äù  She called out, ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù but received no answer.',
     'So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.',
     'There lay her Grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.',
     '‚ÄúOh!',
     'Grandmother,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhat big ears you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to hear you with, my Child,‚Äù was the reply.',
     '‚ÄúBut, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!‚Äù she said.',
     '‚ÄúThe better to see you with, my dear.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut, Grandmother, what large hands you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to hug you with.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh!',
     'but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to eat you with!‚Äù And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.',
     'When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.',
     'The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, ‚ÄúHow the old woman is snoring!',
     'I must just see if she wants anything.‚Äù  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf lying in it.',
     '‚ÄúDo I find thee here, thou old sinner!‚Äù said he.',
     '‚ÄúI have long sought thee!‚Äù  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved.',
     'So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.',
     'When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ‚ÄúAh, how frightened I have been!',
     'How dark it was inside the Wolf!‚Äù  And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.',
     'Red-Cap then quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the Wolf‚Äôs body.',
     'And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.',
     'Then all three were delighted.',
     'The huntsman drew off the Wolf‚Äôs skin and went home with it.',
     'The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and grew strong again.',
     'But Red-Cap thought to herself, ‚ÄúAs long as I live, I will never leave the path to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.‚Äù']



To get sentence numbers for each sentence, we can use `enumerate()`.


```python
for number, sentence in enumerate(nltk.sent_tokenize(text)):

    29 Open the door.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLift the latch,‚Äù called out the Grandmother, ‚ÄúI am too weak, and cannot get up.‚Äù  The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the Grandmother‚Äôs bed, and devoured her.
    30 Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed, and drew the curtains.
    31 Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers.
    32 When she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.
    33 She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open.
    34 And when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to herself, ‚ÄúOh dear!
    35 how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with Grandmother so much.‚Äù  She called out, ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù but received no answer.
    36 So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
    37 There lay her Grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.
    38 ‚ÄúOh!
    39 Grandmother,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhat big ears you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to hear you with, my Child,‚Äù was the reply.
    40 ‚ÄúBut, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!‚Äù she said.
    41 ‚ÄúThe better to see you with, my dear.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut, Grandmother, what large hands you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to hug you with.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh!
    42 but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe better to eat you with!‚Äù And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.
    43 When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.
    44 The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, ‚ÄúHow the old woman is snoring!
    45 I must just see if she wants anything.‚Äù  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf lying in it.
    46 ‚ÄúDo I find thee here, thou old sinner!‚Äù said he.
    47 ‚ÄúI have long sought thee!‚Äù  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved.
    48 So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.
    49 When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ‚ÄúAh, how frightened I have been!
    50 How dark it was inside the Wolf!‚Äù  And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.
    51 Red-Cap then quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the Wolf‚Äôs body.
    52 And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.
    53 Then all three were delighted.
    54 The huntsman drew off the Wolf‚Äôs skin and went home with it.
    55 The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and grew strong again.
    56 But Red-Cap thought to herself, ‚ÄúAs long as I live, I will never leave the path to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.‚Äù


### Make DataFrame

For convenience, we can put all of the sentences into a pandas DataFrame. One easy way to make a DataFrame is to first make a list of dictionaries.

Below we loop through the sentences, calculate sentiment scores, and then create a dictionary with the sentence, sentence numnber, and compound score, which we append to the list `sentence_scores`.


```python
# Break text into sentences
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)

# Make empty list
sentence_scores = []
# Get each sentence and sentence number, which is what enumerate does
for number, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
    # Use VADER to calculate sentiment
    scores = sentimentAnalyser.polarity_scores(sentence)
    # Make dictionary and append it to the previously empty list
    sentence_scores.append({'sentence': sentence, 'sentence_number': number+1, 'sentiment_score': scores['compound']})
```

To make this list of dictionaries into a DataFrame, we can simply use `pd.DataFrame()`


```python
pd.DataFrame(sentence_scores)
```

### Make a Sentiment Plot

To create a data visualization of sentiment over the course of "Little Red Cap," we can plot the sentiment scores over story time (aka sentence number).


```python
red_df['sentiment_score'].plot();
```


    
![png](Sentiment-Analysis_files/Sentiment-Analysis_78_0.png)
    


We can also add a little formatting and styling to make it more readable.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ax = red_df['sentiment_score'].plot(x='sentence_number', y='sentiment_score', kind='line',
                        figsize=(10,5), rot=90, title='Sentiment in "Little-Red Cap"')

# Plot a horizontal line at 0
plt.axhline(y=0, color='orange', linestyle='-');
```


    
![png](Sentiment-Analysis_files/Sentiment-Analysis_80_0.png)
    


The plots above show sentiment fluctuating sentence by sentence. But we could also get a more generalized view by getting a "rolling average" 5 sentences at a time (by using the `.rolling()` method with a specified window).


```python
# Get averages for a rolling window, then plot
red_df.rolling(5)['sentiment_score'].mean().plot(x='sentence_number', y='sentiment_score', kind='line',
                        figsize=(10,5), rot=90, title='Sentiment in "Little-Red Cap"')

# Plot a horizontal line at 0
plt.axhline(y=0, color='orange', linestyle='-');
```

The figure above captures the "plot arc" of "Little Red-Cap" relatively well.

The story arc begins positively with Little Red-Cap,¬†"a sweet little girl...loved by every
one who looked at her," setting off into the woods and picking flowers in the sunshine. Then it dips severely when she gets to her grandmother's home, discovers the wolf in her grandmother's clothing, and gets devoured by the wolf. Finally it picks up again when the huntsman cuts open the wolf's stomach and saves Little Red-Cap and her grandmother, and the wolf ultimately dies.

But it should be noted that this is a short and relatively simple story that has very clearly positive and negative words, and VADER does not work as well for all fictional stories.

There are also some tricky moments in this story that help capture how difficult it is to use technologies like VADER to study plot or emotional arcs in stories. For example, the most negative sentence in the story is the moment when the wolf dies: "And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead." Surely this is a negative moment for the wolf, but is this a negative moment for Little Red-Cap, her grandmother, the huntsman, or the reader? It may actually be one of the most positive and triumphant moments. This contradiction helps demonstrate that fictional texts do not typically express straightforward opinions and attitudes the way a social media post might, and thus students and researchers must be careful, cautious, and deliberate when applying sentiment analysis tools to fiction.

### Your Turn! 

- How well do you think VADER sentiment analysis works with tweets and literary texts?
- How do social media posts and literary texts different in the way they express sentiment? What kinds of tweets or literary texts might pose particular problems for VADER?
- What do you think VADER is really measuring?
- Could you imagine using sentiment analysis in a project? If so, how?
