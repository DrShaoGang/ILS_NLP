# NLP Challenges

Language is not precise. Often, the same words or phrases can have multiple meanings. For example, consider the term weather. You might be under the weather, which means that you are sick. However, there is wonderful weather outside means that the weather conditions outside are good. Words can have different meanings, which are based on the other words that surround them. The words that surround the words are the context. <br>
 <br>
Words can also have different meaning based on inflection. For example, the phrase Oh, really? might convey surprise, disagreement, or many other meanings, depending on a combination of context and inflection. <br>
  <br>
Some of the main challenges for NLP include: <br>
<b>Discovering the structure of the text<\b> – One of the first tasks of any NLP application is to break the text into meaningful units, such as words, phrases, and sentences. <br>
Labeling data – After the system converts the text to data, the next challenge is to apply labels that represent the various parts of speech. Every language requires a different labeling scheme to match the language’s grammar. <br>
Representing context –. Addressing this challenge is where machine learning can have a significant impact. Because word meaning depends on context, any NLP system needs a way to represent context. It is a large challenge because of the large number of contexts. Converting context into a form that computers can understand is difficult. <br>
Applying grammar – Although grammar defines a structure for language, the application of grammar is nearly infinite. Dealing with the variation in how humans use language is a major challenge for NLP systems <br>
